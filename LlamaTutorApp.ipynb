        "**LlamaTutor** is an AI-powered educational platform designed to help middle school students, specifically those in Florida, with math topics aligned to Florida's B.E.S.T. Standards. It offers personalized tutoring by leveraging state-of-the-art natural language models (like Llama 3.1) and Together AI's API. The application provides students with:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interactive explanations of key concepts.\n",
        "* Step-by-step problem-solving.\n",
        "* Practice questions.\n",
        "* Sources from curated materials like Florida's official benchmarks.\n"

        "#  How LlamaTutor Works\n",
        "\n",
        "**User Input:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Students can type in a topic or select a predefined subject (e.g., Number Sense, Algebraic Reasoning).\n",
        "* The application also accepts specific queries like \"Teach me how to multiply fractions.\"\n",
        "**Integration of Florida Standards:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The system utilizes official educational benchmarks stored in JSON format. These benchmarks are extracted from PDFs provided by the Florida Department of Education.\n",
        "* Example: When a student asks about \"Number Sense,\" the application refers to the stored benchmarks for Grade 6.\n",
        "**Response Generation:**\n",
        "* LlamaTutor uses Together AI's API to fetch responses based on user input.\n",
        "* Example Workflow:\n",
        "  * A student's question is sent to Together AI's chat/completions endpoint.\n",
        "  * The API returns a response, which is displayed to the user in a conversational format.\n",
        "**Educational Sources:**\n",
        "* In addition to generating answers, LlamaTutor fetches reliable sources (web pages, PDFs) related to the student's query using integrated search APIs (e.g., Serper or Bing).\n",
        "* These sources provide additional reading material or videos for further learning.\n",
        "**Interactive Design:**\n",
        "*The app includes quizzes, exercises, and interactive follow-up questions to test comprehension.\n",
        "* Example: After explaining how to multiply fractions, the app asks, \"What is the product of 2/3 and 3/4?\"\n",
        "**Deployment and Accessibility:**\n",
        "* The application is fully deployed on Vercel, allowing easy access for students and teachers. However, this notebook demonstrates its core functionality within Colab.\n"
